    "description": "The Avetta API is a mechanism to allow our customers to retrieve Employee and Role data from Worker Management via application programming interface. The Avetta API is organized around REST and uses HTTP status codes and error payload responses to indicate API errors.\n\nWe leverage the HTTP protocol features, like HTTP verbs and status codes, which are commonly used and are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. All API responses (including errors) will be returned in JSON format.\n\n**Host Region**\n\nIn some cases we support regional instances.  The default region value is simply 'worker'.  Making the host value evaulate to https://worker.avetta.com. If told to use a regional url other than the default is used append the region identifier after worker.  eg. https://worker-au.avetta.com\n\n**Versioning <- IMPORTANT UPDATE MUST READ ->**\n\nYou will notice in this documentation that the URL for this API is as follows: https://worker.avetta.com/api/vXâ€¦ This URL contains vX to specify the particular version to be used when making the desired call. Different versions of the same endpoint may return different results, therefore it is important to note the versions of each endpoint in this documentation. Please be aware of this as you check each endpoint.\n\n**Authentication**\n\nWhen using the API, include your secret API key in the request for the service to authenticate your account. This API Key will be provided to you by your point of contact in Avetta.\nAll API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls to the service over HTTP will result in a 302 Redirect response to the HTTPS end-point. API requests without an apikey will fail.\n\n**Errors**\n\nAvetta uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, an invalid account number, validation failure, etc.), and in rare situations, codes in the 5xx range indicate a server error.\n\n**Pagination**\n\nAvetta has a default maximum limit of 3000 results in one API call. In the case where the response returns more than the default limit, you must utilize pagination to retrieve the full data set. Avetta utilizes cursor-based pagination via optional start and limit query string parameters. The start indicates the record to start with for pagination and the limit indicates the total number of records to return (maximum of 3000).\n",
